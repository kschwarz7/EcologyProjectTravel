        On this trip you get to experience a lot. I got to take part in one of
        their student based travel programs in Baja, Mexico. We got to have
        hands on experience with scientists and locals to collect data and help
        in local conservation efforts.

          Scientist Partners
          EPI partners with world-class scientists and scientific institutions at all of its program sites, but students aren't here for lectures. They'll assist in on-going research on critically threatened wildlife and ecosystems.

          Engaging Communities
          At EPI, all education, even science education, takes place within a cultural context. Cultural exchange is an essential element of their programs. We were able to learn from one another throughout the whole trip.
